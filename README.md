# EightQueens.py
Trying to solve the eight queens problem once and for all. 

My late father once told me that once I solved the eight queens problem, I could play chess (with him). Looking back, I'm pretty sure he just wanted a few minutes of silence, but the problem stuck with me ever since. 

I was way young when I got the problem, maybe 6 or 7. I solved it years later as a teenager with a good friend, and have used it to break the ice on an occasion or two. 

This program is my attempt to search for all solutions to the eight queens problem with the help of a computer. My laptop might be too weak to search through the 8 combination of 64 fields, so if you know someone who has access to a supercomputer, definitely let me know. 

THe program uses the itertools library for generating solutions, and some unreviewed math for checking the movement of the queen pieces. 

I hope it should theoretically work on a really fast computer, please feel free to contact me with suggestions. 

I know the search space for this program is astronomical, but who knows, maybe if I leave the computer running long enough. Maybe there's a better way of finding all solutions to the eight queens problem. Please let me know if you know one.
